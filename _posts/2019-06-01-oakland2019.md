([Medium Post](https://medium.com/@garyan95/current-trends-in-security-research-from-oakland-2019-43e81c25d28c)) I attended the IEEE Oakland Security and Privacy Conference last week and thought I would share a few thoughts on the major trends I observed in the papers at the conference. These are heavily biased towards my interests in Machine Learning and by no means intended to be comprehensive.
