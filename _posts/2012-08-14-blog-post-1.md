When designing visualizations, making charts that are straightforward to read and interpret is usually desirable. This becomes especially important in settings where users may have to make fast judgements based on the visualizations, such as in emergency rooms or on financial trading floors. In our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03180.pdf) in IEEE INFOVIS 2018, we introduce a new method for quantifying visual complexity, Pixel Approximate Entropy, that can be used to develop better visualizations in these types of settings.
