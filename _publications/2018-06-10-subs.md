excerpt: 'Measurement  of  real  systems,  which  are  dynamic  in  nature, encounter  unknown  configuration  bugs  and  have  sensitivities  to the vagaries of human nature and adversarial behavior, requires a formal means   to continuously test and evaluate deployed detection systems. We present a framework to deploying in situ simulated user bots (SUBs) that can emulate the actions of real users.'
